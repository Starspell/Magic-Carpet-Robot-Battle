physics
    fix the gate passing detection
    better carpet/buoy collision
sounds
    moving block sounds last longer than the time to move a block
    robot moving alone?
    bouncing off buoys (use clang?)
    use clang for hitting the wrong target?
    sea ambience
    clang sound quieter
    (still need to test gate pass/fail - they might sound out-of-place)
    grinding on a carpet is just weird (METAL CARPET)
    gatePass is too loud
graphics
    better number colours/style
    robot grabbing animation
make some courses
