physics
    better carpet/buoy collision

sounds
	music
    moving block sounds last longer than the time to move a block
	robot moving alone?
    bouncing off buoys (use clang?)
    use clang for hitting the wrong target?
    sea ambience
    clang sound quieter
    gate pass/fail are a little out-of-place
    grinding on a carpet is just weird (METAL CARPET)
    gatePass is too loud

graphics

		maybe make them yellow?
    number 2 isn't placed perfectly

    level editor
